Zeitwerk::NameError (wrong constant name ProductsController.

    parent.const_defined?(cname, false)
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ inferred by Module from file

  /home/chakras/personal_workspace/xen-electronic/be/app/controllers/api/products_controller..rb

Possible ways to address this:

  * Tell Zeitwerk to ignore this particular file.
  * Tell Zeitwerk to ignore one of its parent directories.
  * Rename the file to comply with the naming conventions.
  * Modify the inflector to handle this case.
